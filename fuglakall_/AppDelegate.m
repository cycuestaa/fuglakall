     You specify your app’s notification types and custom actions using UNNotificationCategory and UNNotificationAction objects. You create these objects at initialization time and register them with the user notification center. Even if you register custom actions, the action in the response parameter might indicate that the user dismissed the notification without performing any of your actions.
     
     If you do not implement this method, your app never responds to custom actions.
